The Dean Lab at UTSW
####################

The Dean Lab is a multi-disciplinary team of biologists, chemists, physicists, and engineers
at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. We develop
advanced microscopy technologies to study cellular signaling processes in
complex tissue contexts. Our goal is to understand how cells make decisions in the context
of their native environment, and how these decisions go awry in disease. More information
about our research can be found on our `website <https://www.dean-lab.org>`_.

**Research Projects**
=====================

- `navigate <https://thedeanlab.github.io/navigate/>`_ - Light-sheet microscopy software packages for intelligent imaging of complex tissue samples. navigate is equipped with a series of plugins that extend its functionality, enabling the use of `robotics <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-at-scale>`_, imaging cells in a `projection format <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-confocal-projection>`_, accessing additional `hardware <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-mmcore-plugin>`_, and leveraging real-time feedback from `ilastik  <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-ilastik-server>`_. To enable users to generate their own plugins, we provide a `plugin template <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate-plugin-template>`_.

- `Altair <https://thedeanlab.github.io/altair/>`_ - A series of cost-effective, easy-to-assemble, and performant light-sheet microscopes for interrogating cells and tissues at the highest resolution.

**Educational Resources**
=========================

- `CI2023 <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/CI2023>`_ - An introduction to continuous integration and continuous deployment for scientific software.

**Publication Repositories**
============================

For many manuscripts published over the years, we provide access to CAD files, software, and data
via GitHub. These repositories are organized by publication year. You can find this information :ref:`publications-home`.
